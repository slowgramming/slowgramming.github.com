Entire industries (cough, cough, Java) have been built on orthodoxy that things have to be this way.

Hindu Milk Miracle:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_milk_miracle

On September 21,1995, August 21, 2006 and January 13, 2008, news swept around the world of the extraordinary miracles of milk-drinking Hindu statues appearing everywhere. Never before in history had a simultaneous miracle occurred on such a global scale.

Thomas Paine:

I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.

Last person to be burned at the stake for heresy in England.
Wightman's trial was played out against the backdrop of the so-called “Vorstius Affair”, involving the intense opposition on the King’s part to block the appointment of the German academic Conrad Vorstius to the University of Leiden. Vorstius was being accused of atheism, Arianism and heretical opinions about the Holy Spirit.

"... of other cursed opinions belched by the instinct of Satan”."

"Al-Razi believed that common people had originally been duped into belief by religious authority figures and by the status quo. He believed that these authority figures were able to continually deceive the common people "as a result of [religious people] being long accustomed to their religious denomination, as days passed and it became a habit. Because they were deluded by the beards of the goats, who sit in ranks in their councils, straining their throats in recounting lies, senseless myths and "so-and-so told us in the name of so-and-so…"[26]"

This series "Slowgramming: AngularJS and Rails" demonstrates the power of using AngularJS and Rails together. I've been fascinated by AngularJS ever since seeing Misko Hevry, an engineer at Google, discussed it at JSConf in Portland, OR in June of 2011. It was my favorite talk of the event. I've been successfully developing applications using AngularJS ever since and now rarely resort to other tools which I used to love, specifically jQuery.

But, and it needs to be said: this series is as much a series on technology as it is an attack on orthodoxy. For many years now we've been using JavaScript frameworks that sought to lessen the load of developing rich web applications. Prototype, followed by jQuery, followed by BackboneJS and EmberJS, and there are many others. Each one has been marginally better than the last. But, I assert (and many others who have made the switch will agree with me) that AngularJS is a heretical shift in opening up what is possible with web applications. My AngularJS t-shirt, given to contributors of the GitHub repository, loudly proclaims "10x less code!" and my own development confirms how little code I need to write to build powerful web applications.

If you look at the two most popular tools which claim to provide the same services as AngularJS, you'll see one has this description:
<blockquote>...gives structure to web applications by providing  <b>models</b>  with key-value binding and custom events,  <b>collections</b>  with a rich API of enumerable functions,<b>views</b>  with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface</blockquote>
Is this description a tad dogmatic, a strong assertion that this is the best way to do things? Perhaps it is the right way, but are you ready to accept all of that when using this tool? Is it intricately tangled together? Can you question even one of these pieces without losing favor from those gods?

And, if you look at another competitor to AngularJS, you see code like this:
<pre>App.Person = DS.Model.extend({
  firstName: DS.attr('string'),
  lastName: DS.attr('string'),

  fullName: function() {
    return this.get('firstName') +
           " " + this.get('lastName');
  }.property('firstName', 'lastName')
});

App.peopleController = Em.ArrayController.create({
  content: App.Person.findAll()
});</pre>
Underneath the claim that building with "X is easy!" you immediately need to understand what extending DS.Model does, what the "attr" function does to DS (and what is DS, again? Death Scythe?),  what the property function implies and whether it has side effects, what the ArrayController is, and how findAll()   connects to "content." If you don't agree this is "easy," then beware! You'll be excommunicated from the realm.

We cannot investigate and truly understand AngularJS until we address the elephant in the room: the orthodoxy of the current JS application options. More specifically, that in order to write JavaScript applications you need to be a JavaScript expert, that you need to understand advanced design patterns. That, building JavaScript applications needs to be hard and complicated. That you have to choose a large complicated JavaScript design pattern and framework that does not play nicely with other frameworks; the orthodoxy of all or nothing. AngularJS demonstrates it does not have to be this way.

In contrast to the examples above, the first example on the AngularJS homepage shows you this code:
<pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html ng-app&gt; 
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.4/angular.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt; 
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;div ng-app&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
 &lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input type="text" ng-model="yourName" placeholder="Enter a name here"&gt;
 &lt;hr&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Hello {{yourName}}!&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
This is a complete web application, all the nuts and bolts are there in full view. And, you only need to assess four things: a &lt;script&gt; tag which inserts AngularJS. If insertion of a JavaScript using the script tag does not fall into consideration as "natural law" when developing web applications, I don't know what does. Then, an tiny attribute called ng-app inside the HTML tag. And, then we see a new attribute tag "ng-model" and a the name ("yourName") provided to that attribute within two curly braces. The application runs right next to the code snippet. We have no design patterns to contemplate, no complicated backstory or history to assess. Just a powerful and lightweight web development tool. I say "now, <strong>this</strong> is easy!" AngularJS lets me get into a zen mind state when coding; I can forget complicated structures and ideas, and simply think about the functionality of my application. AngularJS can do many more complicated things than what this initial example demonstrates, but the point is that you don't have to use anything unless you deem it worthy for your particular application. As they used to say on the AngularJS home page: "sprinkle in a little or pour it on     no need for a big, scary commitment."

Entire industries in the software world have been built on orthodoxy that things have to be "this way." Ruby on Rails was as much a response to the orthodoxy of web development using Java as it served a need for people. The initial versions of Rails noted   that it was a "web application framework and environment for building real-world applications with joy and less code than most frameworks spend doing XML sit-ups" which was a direct jab at Java and its heavily reliance on XML. Rails was a revelation to me personally and the community still is like no other in their preference of empirical and data-driven approaches over dogma. And, AngularJS is an affront to the orthodoxy of JavaScript development in the browser in much the same way. You can expect the same heated   responses to AngularJS from true believers of other frameworks, who have personally and professionally invested so much into their way of thinking, but heated zeal often conceals the opportunity for real breakthroughs. AngularJS and Rails are a good philosophical bedfellows for all these reasons.

In light of this, to introduce each section of the series, I want to highlight several skeptics and critics of orthodoxy from ages ago. Often we can see the same patterns in their thinking as we see in the evolution of programming development and languages. "Flame wars" at least in this era, happily, never end in a real burning at the stake. Many of these atheists or skeptics or zindiqs (Arabic for heretic)  did indeed meet that fate. So, let's meet them in the pages that follow and see what thought patterns emerge as we learn about AngularJS and Rails playing together.

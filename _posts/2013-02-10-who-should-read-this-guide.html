This guide tells you about best practices in developing AngularJS web applications on Rails.

It is not meant as a guide to teach you every intricacy of AngularJS. There are many other better suited guides out there. You will definitely learn a lot about AngularJS and if you want a comprehensive guide, the best place is the <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS.org</a> website.

It is best to have a basic understanding of Rails. You don't need to be a Rails expert, and in fact I avoided any extremely complicated Rails patterns so that this guide would be accesible to people who are new to Rails.

You do need some programming experience. If you are a complete newbie to software development, you will probably struggle a bit. And, I've designed the tutorials to be conversational and step-by-step. Drawing from my experiences learning Aikido while living in Japan, I realize that sometimes you just need to do repeatedly in order to learn, and this guide hopefully can take you through the steps even though you may not understand exactly what you are doing until the end, or even long after but upon reflection.

I also explain the "why" when building something, which I think is often lacking in many explanations. Many guides are good at explaining the how (computers need exactly instructions on the "how") but humans need the context provided from the why.
